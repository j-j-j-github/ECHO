# 🌬️ ECHO - Seek the Silence

A minimalist, anonymous social interaction platform built on the philosophy of ephemeral digital communication. This project moves away from permanent digital footprints to a "fading" architectural experience, demonstrating modern full-stack development using React, Supabase Realtime, and PostgreSQL.

## ✨ Unique Features (v1.0)

⏳ 48-Hour Lifecycle: Engineered a "Fading Data" system where every Echo (post) and Resonance (reply) automatically expires after 48 hours, mimicking the natural decay of human memory.

🕵️ Absolute Anonymity: Identity is managed via a local-first UUID signature system. No accounts, no email tracking, and no PII (Personally Identifiable Information) stored on the server.

📱 Instagram-Style Desktop UI: A sophisticated two-pane modal interaction system that separates the main thought from its expanding resonance sidebar, optimized for high-end aesthetic clarity.

🔔 Intelligent Resonance Alerts: A minimalist bell icon with a "breathing" glow effect that notifies users of new replies specifically linked to their anonymous signature.

🎨 High-End Monochrome Aesthetic: A strictly black-and-white interface utilizing Glass-morphism, vertical typography, and fluid Framer Motion animations.

🛡️ Robust Text Architecture: Implemented advanced CSS break-words and overflow-wrap-anywhere logic to ensure layout integrity against long strings or unbreakable text.

## 🛠️ Core Features

Anonymous Whispers: Create and release Echoes into the public grid without a login.

Threaded Resonances: Reply to others through a sleek, card-based chat interface within the post view.

Real-time Sync: Powered by Supabase to reflect new whispers across the globe instantly.

Interactive Grid: A responsive layout displaying active thoughts and their remaining time.

The Secret Log: A side-drawer that tracks resonances for your signature, clearing as the data fades.
